### Description

Logic Boom is a Rave/Techno Beat drum synthesizer made with DirectX® 8.0's Direct Music®. So far, it has many instruments to choose from, variable tempo, and unlimited song length, one downfall is, you cant export as a Wave sound file, I am working on the program save feature right now, but until then, please enjoy the download, and let me know what you think of it!<br><br>

P.S. - I don't care so much about the voting, if you want, you can, it might encourage me to work harder and post more, but I would greatly appriciate your feedback so I know how to make things better, thank you!
 
### More Info
 
You need the DirectX SDK to compile
